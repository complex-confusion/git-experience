Waking, it's all the same old. Bed, white sheets, no clothes, no wallet, no books on the endtable. 

No plans for the day, no idea of yesterday. No name.

Why do I find this familiar? Shouldn't this be more disturbing?

Should I be doing something else. Yes, I should -- start with the door, but it's locked.
